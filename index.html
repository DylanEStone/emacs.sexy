      Emacs is a <strong>text editor</strong> which you can customize and extend in so many
      ways. It was written in <strong>Lisp</strong>, the language from which <em>the Gods
        wrought the universe</em>.

    <p>
      There's a reason why Emacs was

      GNU Emacs is <strong>Free Software</strong>, free as in beer and
      free as in free speech. The original Emacs was written by <em>St.
      iGNUcius himself</em> - <strong>Richard Stallman</strong>.

      Not only does it give the user
      the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four
        essential freedoms</a>, its architecture is built in such a way
      that you have the power to mold it, change it and make it comply
      to your computering ways.

      - Me</blockquote>
    <p>
      It's not called the <em> self-documenting real-time display
        editor</em> for nothing. Emacs includes a great tutorial to
      <strong>teach you how to use Emacs while you're using
      Emacs</strong>. Mind blown? This is just the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've installed Emacs, start it up. You will be greeted
      with a welcome screen. From there you can click on the <em>Emacs
      Tutorial</em> link.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also start tasting the tip of the rainbow by
      pressing <code>Alt + X</code> which will take you to
      the <em>command mode</em> on the lower screen of Emacs. Then
      write <code>help-with-tutorial</code> and press Enter. You just
      entered the first of many Emacs commands. You know that warm
      feeling in your stomach? Get used to it, because there's more
      where that came from.

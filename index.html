      Emacs is a <strong>text editor</strong> which you can customize and extend in so many
      ways. It was written in <strong>Lisp</strong>, the language from which <em>the Gods
        wrought the universe</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a reason why Emacs was
      <a href="http://jtnimoy.net/workviewer.php?q=178" title="Emacs on
      Tron Legacy">featured in Tron Legacy</a>, it is sexy! (and
      awesome).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use Emacs for all of your text processing
      needs, internet and social network interactions, hacking,
      coding, managing to-do's and organizing your daily schedule,
      play Tetris and it can even provide you with free psychotherapy and
      counseling using <code>M-x doctor</code>.
    </p>
    <p>

      GNU Emacs is <strong>Free Software</strong>, free as in beer and
      free as in free speech. The original Emacs was written by <em>St.
      iGNUcius himself</em> - <strong>Richard Stallman</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only does it give the user
      the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four
        essential freedoms</a>, its architecture is built in such a way
      that you have the power to mold it, change it and make it comply
      to your computering needs.

    <h2>Learn Emacs</h2>
    <blockquote>Mastering Emacs is not the goal, it's the path.<br>
      - A happy Emacs user</blockquote>
    <p>
      It's not called the <em> self-documenting real-time display
        editor</em> for nothing. Emacs includes a great tutorial to
      <strong>teach you how to use Emacs while you're using
      Emacs</strong>. Mind blown? This is just the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've installed Emacs, start it up. You will be greeted
      with a welcome screen. From there you can click on the <em>Emacs
      Tutorial</em> link with your mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Instead of using your mouse</strong>, you can
      press <code>Alt + X</code> on your keyboard, which will take you
      to the <em>command mode</em> on the lower screen of Emacs. Then
      write <code>help-with-tutorial</code> and press Enter. You just
      entered the first of many Emacs commands. You know the warm
      fuzzies you just got? Get used to it, because there's more where
      that came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interactive tutorial will teach you the basics on how to
      move around and edit text. It's just the tip of the iceberg, and
      you quest has just began.

      Emacs is a <strong>text editor</strong> which you can customize
      and extend in so many ways. It was written in C and provides its
      own implementation of <strong>Lisp</strong>,
      <a href="https://xkcd.com/224/"> the language from which <em> the
          Gods wrought the universe</em></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a reason why Emacs was
      <a href="http://jtnimoy.net/workviewer.php?q=178" title="Emacs
      on Tron Legacy">featured in Tron Legacy</a>, it is sexy! (and
      awesome).
    </p>
    <img src="img/emacs.png" alt="Emacs" class="mobile"/>
    <p>
      You can use Emacs for all of your text processing
      needs, internet and social network interactions, hacking,
      coding, managing to-do's and organizing your daily schedule,
      play Tetris and it can even provide you with free psychotherapy and
      counseling using <code>M-x doctor</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!--img src="img/emacs-logo.png" alt="Emacs" class="left" /-->
      GNU Emacs is <strong>Free Software</strong>, free as in free beer and
      free as in free speech. The original Emacs was written
      by <em>St. iGNUcius himself</em>&nbsp;&mdash; <strong>Richard Stallman</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only does it give the user
      the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four
        essential freedoms</a>, its architecture is built in such a way
      that you have the power to mold it, change it and make it comply
      to your computering needs.

    <h2>Why using Emacs?</h2>
    It's a very powerful text processor, allowing you to manipulate
    blocks of text, paragraphs, words, finding, replacing, using
    regular expressions, keyboard macros and more.
    <h3>Colorful text editor</h3>
    <p>
      Emacs can be adapted in every possible way, including its looks.
      You can <a href="http://bzg.fr/emacs-strip-tease.html">strip it</a>,
      choose between several themes with <code>M-x load-theme</code>,
      download one from another happy Emacs user or create your
      own. <a href="http://emacsthemes.com/" title="Emacs
      Themes">Here's a nice gallery of themes</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Et tu, Programmer?</h3>
    <p>
      There are tools for probably every programming language out
      there. Lisp, Ruby, Python, PHP, Java, Erlang, JavaScript, C,
      C++, Prolog, Tcl, AWK, PostScript, Clojure, Scala,
      Perl, Haskell, Elixir all of these languages and more are
      supported in Emacs.
    </p>
    <p>
      You get syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, running code
      inside the editor, debugging, code browsing, version control
      systems integration and much more.
    </p>
    <h3>More!</h3>
    <p>
      <code><a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a></code> helps
      you keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planing projects and
      authoring documents. You can even create HTML websites like this
      one or export to your documents as LaTeX, Beamer, OpenDocuments
      and many more formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>Tramp</code> allows you to edit remote files without
      leaving Emacs. You can edit files via SSH and edit local files
      with su/sudo, among other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>ERC</code> is a built-in IRC client
      and <code>BitlBee</code> can be used as a gateway for several IM services.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use mail client, web browser, calendar, games, even
      edit video and images inside Emacs. There
      are <a href="http://bruce-connor.github.io/emacs-archive-tracker/"
      title="Emacs package archives">more than 2,000</a> packages for
      Emacs.  You can install more packages with <code>M-x

    <h2>Installing Emacs</h2>
    <p>
      You can install Emacs on almost every operating system out
      there. The officially supported systems are GNU, GNU/Linux,
      FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X, MS Windows and Solaris.
    </p>
    <h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
    <p>
      GNU Emacs is available on most GNU/Linux distributions. It's
      available out of the box on some of them. If it's not, you can
      use your system's package manager (apt, yum, pacman, etc.)
      or <a href="http://gnu.c3sl.ufpr.br/ftp/emacs/" title="Download
      Emacs">download Emacs from the GNU site</a>.

      It's not called the <em> self-documenting real-time display
        editor</em> for nothing. Emacs includes a great tutorial to
      <strong>teach you how to use Emacs while you're using
        Emacs</strong>. Mind blown? This is just the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've installed Emacs, start it up. You will be  greeted
      with a welcome  screen. From there you can click on
      the <em>Emacs Tutorial</em> link with your mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Instead of using your mouse</strong>, you can
      press <code>Alt + X</code> on your keyboard, which will take you
      to the <em>command mode</em> on the lower screen of Emacs. Then
      write <code>help-with-tutorial</code> and press Enter. You just
      entered the first of many Emacs commands. You know the warm
      fuzzies you just got? Get used to it, because there's more where
      that came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interactive tutorial will teach you the basics on how to
      move around and edit text. It's just the tip of the iceberg, and
      your quest has just begun.
